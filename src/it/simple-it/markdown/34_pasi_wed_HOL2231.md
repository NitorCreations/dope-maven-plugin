# Raspberry Pi NightHacking #

* Stephen Chin and Simon Ritter showed the basics of JavaFX on RaspberryPI
* Second hour was trying to get something nice with JavaFX running on the PI
    * We decided to work together with Mikko and his partner 
       so were able to iron out minor kinks quickly
    * Went for pong game
    * Begin with just moving a ball
    * Mikko & partner started working on bouncing off walls
    * Pasi & partner started working on keyboard interaction
    * Moving a ball with the keyboard was selected best in the class
