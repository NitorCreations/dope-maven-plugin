# Lambda Expressions #
* Re-written to use lambda and Collection.forEach
  * Not just a syntactic change!
  * Now the library is in control
  * This is internal iteration
  * More what, less how
* Library free to use parallelism, out-of-order execution, laziness
* Client passes behavior into the API as data
* Enables API designers to build more powerful, expressive APIs
  * Greater power to abstract over behavior
