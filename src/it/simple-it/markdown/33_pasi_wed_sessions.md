# Wednesday #

##  Implement a High-Level Parallel API in JDK ##

* Taxi problems so we were late and session was full
* Slides are less exciting than the title would lead to believe
    * Basically an introduction into parallel programming with nothing new

## Vaadin 7 by Joonas Lehtinen (CEO, Vaadin) ##

* Good for rich apps with limited user base
    * All state in the server -> memory footprint
    * Not optimized for read-heavy workloads
* Nice set of ready components (e.g. UI & data binding)
* Websocket push trivial to implement (Just annotate with `@Push`)
