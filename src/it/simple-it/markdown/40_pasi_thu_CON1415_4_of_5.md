# Visualization and Persistence #

* Hosted Graphite
    * Allows generating graphs of basically any data
    * No tools to support multiple similar environments (API as a workaround)
* Cubism - Open Source javascript library for plotting time series
    * Supports Graphite out-of-the-box
    * Maximizes on-screen efficiency so lots of data can be plotted on one screen
* New Relic
    * Run-time agent that hooks into frameworks (e.g. Spring MVC)
    * Gives profiling data on how framework calls are handled

### Others ##
    
* Nagios for health status and notifications
* JMeter + Graphite for estimating scaling
